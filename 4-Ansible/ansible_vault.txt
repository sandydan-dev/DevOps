# Ansible Vault 


# what is ansible vault?
> ansible valult is a built-in tool that encrypts and decripts sensitive data files or variables so they are
  safe to store in your playbooks or git repository

> Normally, ansible playbook main contain sensitive data (like: passwrd, API keys, certification, etc)
  if you use them as plain text, anyone can read them. 

> why it exits: so you can keep secrets alongside playbook ingit without storeing them as a plain text. 

# we can create envcrypted file using 
cmd: ansible-vault create secret_file.yml 
> this will create file as encrypted
  - ansible-valult create: it tell ansible vault to create or encripts file

# to view and edit late
cmd: ansible-vault view secret_file.yml 
> it will open encrypted file 

# edit ansible-vault secret_file.yml file 
cmd: ansible-vault edit secret_file.yml 
- it tell ansible-vault to edit this secret file 


# if have already playbook then make it encrypted
cmd: ansible-valut encript vars.yml 

# decript a file back in plain text 
cmd: ansible-vault decript vars.yml 

# change the vault key 
cmd: ansible-valut rekey vars.yml
