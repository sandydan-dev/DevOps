# Tomcat

✅ What is Tomcat?
- Tomcat is a open source webserver and servlet container deployed by the Apache Tomcat Foundation.

👉 Tomcat = java webserver + servlet/jsp engin

> it is mainly used to run java-based application, especially application that used: 
- Servlet
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- Java Websocket
- Java Expression Language (EL)

✅ Why do we use Tomcat?

1️⃣ To deploy java based applications
- If you build a web application using java (Servlet/JSP), you need a server that can execute those .war
  files.

2️⃣ Lightweight alternative to full Java EE servers
- other servers like
  - WebLogic
  - WildFly/ JBoss
  - GlassFish 

- are heavy because they support fully java EE features like (EJB, JMS, etc)    
- Tomcat is Lightweight, easy to install, and perfect for small to medium java apps.

3️⃣ Ideal for DevOps and Production
- Tomcat is widely used in DevOps pipelines for:
  - CI/CD developments
  - Hosting backend java services
  - Running REST API's 


4️⃣ Tomcat is free 
- Used everywhere

# Download Tomcat Step by step:

1: update package 
cmd: sudo yum update -y 


✅ Install Java on Amazon Linux 2023
✔ Option 1 — Install Amazon Corretto 21 (recommended)
cmd: sudo dnf install java-21-amazon-corretto

Verify:
cmd: java -version

✅ Install tomcat (zip file from tomcat site)

go to: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
- search : Binary Distributions
core: tar.gz (pgp. sha512) (copy this link)
- past this into MobaXterm
cmd: wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.112/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.112.tar.gz

- after installing tomcat it show file like 
  file: apache-tomcat-9.0.112.tar.gz

- now extract tar.gz file 
cmd: tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-9.0.112.tar.gz

- verify extracted file 
cmd: ls 

result: apache-tomcat-9.0.112

> now go inside /bin directory 
cmd: cd /bin 

- search tomcat: startup.sh file (shell script file)
✅ Go inside the correct Tomcat bin directory
cmd: cd /apache-tomcat-9.0.112/bin     ([root@ip-172-31-70-16 ~]# as root)

> see file "startup.sh" 
- shell scripting means run command in all machines that call scripting (.sh) file 

# now give the full permission inside this directory 
cmd: chmod 777 startup.sh 

# run file like 
cmd: ./startup.sh

result: tomcat started 

# Tomcat runs on port 8080, port connections. 

# EC2 inbound rule add port range 8080 then save rules. 

# After adding rules, take EC2 instance public IP and past into browser
> 44.222.190.91:8080    (IP:8080) port 
- this will show tomcat web content 

# Now tomcat server is ready
