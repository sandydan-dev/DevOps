AWS pricing is based on Pay-as-you-go, meaning:

You pay only for what you use.
There is no upfront cost.
No termination fees.

But AWS pricing changes depending on usage, region, instance type, storage class, data transfer, etc.

⭐ Three Main Ways AWS Charges You

1️⃣ Compute (EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS)

AWS charges based on:
- Instance type (t2.micro vs t3.medium etc.)
- Instance size (CPU + RAM)
- Time used (per second or per hour)
- Region (Mumbai vs Oregon)
- Operating System (Linux cheaper, Windows higher)
- Reserved Instances (sign 1–3 year commitment → discount)
- Spot Instances (spare capacity → cheapest)

Example:
t2.micro = cheap
t2.large = more cost
t3.large + Windows = even more cost


2️⃣ Storage (S3, EBS, Glacier)

AWS charges for:
- Storage amount (GB)
- Storage class
  - S3 Standard: expensive
  - S3 IA (Infrequent Access): cheaper
  - S3 Glacier: very cheap
- PUT / GET requests
- Data transfer outside region

Example:
Store 10GB in S3 Standard → Higher cost  
Store same 10GB in Glacier → Lower cost


3️⃣ Data Transfer

AWS charges for:
- Outbound data (internet) → $$$
- Inbound data → FREE
- Between AZs → cost
- Between regions → cost
- Within same VPC AZ → FREE

Example:
EC2 → S3 same region = free
EC2 → internet = costly


⭐ Why AWS Pricing Changes Automatically

AWS updates billing based on your resource usage:

| Action You Do             | AWS Billing Change                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Launch EC2 instance       | Cost increases                         |
| Stop EC2 instance         | Compute cost stops (EBS still charges) |
| Delete S3 files           | Storage cost decreases                 |
| Move data to Glacier      | Storage cost decreases                 |
| Large traffic to internet | Cost increases                         |
| Use Reserved Instances    | Cost decreases                         |
| Use Spot Instances        | Cost decreases a lot                   |
