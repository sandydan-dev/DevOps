AWS Security Group

It is a firewall which is stand front of instance, and manage traffic (inbound / outbound)

An AWS Security Group (SG)  is like a virtual firewall that controls INBOUND (comming inside) and
OUTBOUND (going outside) traffic for your EC2 Instance 


Act as virtual firewall    =  Works at EC2 instance level
Stateful                   = if you allow incoming traffic, return traffic is automatically allowd 
Inbound rules              = Control traffic comming into your instance
Ountbound rules            = control traffic going out from your instance
Allow only                 = you cannot deny, you can only ALLOW ports/IPs
Default Security Group     = Block all inbound, allows all outbound


Security Group is Stateful
If you allow Inbound Port 80 (HTTP):
✅ You do NOT need to add outbound rule
Because outbound (reply) is automatically allowed.

Same for SSH:
Allow inbound SSH (22) → reply is auto allowed.


🎯 3. Most Common Security Group Rules
👉 For Web Server (Nginx/Apache):
Inbound:
- Port 22 (SSH) — only your IP
- Port 80 (HTTP) — anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
- Port 443 (HTTPS) — anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

Outbound:
- All traffic allowed (default)


✔ Best Inbound Rules:

| Type  | Port | Source       | Purpose               |
| ----- | ---- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| SSH   | 22   | Your IP only | Secure login          |
| HTTP  | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0    | Website access        |
| HTTPS | 443  | 0.0.0.0/0    | Secure website access |



🔧 6. How Security Group Works Internally
When a request hits your EC2:

Step 1 → Security Group checks:
- Is port allowed?
- Is IP allowed?

Step 2 → If allowed → EC2 receives traffic
If not → traffic blocked automatically


🧠 Difference Between Security Group and NACL

| Feature    | Security Group | Network ACL  |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Level      | Instance-level | Subnet-level |
| Stateful   | Yes            | No           |
| Rules      | Only Allow     | Allow + Deny |
| Complexity | Easy           | Harder       |


# if traffic will comes from other ports / IPs it will block that traffic

# Create Security Group
> Go to EC2 instance 
> Security Group > Create Security Group
> Security group name : ubuntuSG
> Description : ubuntuSG
> VPC         : default

Inbound rules > add rules
type: ssh 
port range: 22 
Source : MyIP(only me) / anywhere(for all)

Outbound rules
type: All traffic
port range: all
destination : customIP   > 0.0.0.0/0

> Create Secure Group
