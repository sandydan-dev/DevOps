# What is Ansible 
> Ansible is an open-source automation tool to manage services, deploy applications, and automate IT tasks -- without installing any agents on the target machines. 

> It is use ssh connection. 

# --------  Uses of Ansible  ---------- #

# 1: Configuration Management
- install packages
- manage files
- configure services (like nginx, apache, mysql)

Example: configure 100 servers exactly the same way with one playbook

# 2: Application Development
- automate code deployment
- manage version releases
- zero-downtime deployments

# 3: Provisioning
- Create servers using clouds API's (AWS, AZURE, GCIP)
- configure them automatically after creation

# 4: Orchestration
- coordinate task in sequence
- Example: start DB > then backend > then frontend

# 5: Continuous Delivery / CI/CD 
- used in pipelines to deploy and configure systems.

# 6: Security automation
- apply security patches 
- update firewall rules 
- enforce compilance rules

# 7: Insfrastructure as Code (IaC)
- your instrastructure configuration is stored in YAML code
- easy to share, version control, and audit.

# ----------- Key Features of Ansible ----------- #

# 1: Agentless
> no need to install agents on target server.
> uses ssh by default -- simple and secure.


# 2: Written in YAML (Ansible Playbook)
> easy to read
> easy to write


# 3: Idempotent
> Running the same playbook multiple times will not change the system if it is already in the desired state.


# 4: Extensible Modules
> Ansible has thousands of built-in modules... 
- yum, apt
- service
- copy, templates 
- docker, k8s, aws, azure 


# 5: Cross platform  works on..
> Linux
> Windows
> Network Devices (Cisco, Jupiter)
> Cloud (AWS, AZURE, GCP)
> Containers (Docker, Kubernetes)


# 6: Push-based model
> You run Ansible from a control code -- it pushes configuration to servers. 
> no agent pulling configs.


# 7: Inventory Management 
> All servers(hosts) are stored in a simple INI or YAML files
